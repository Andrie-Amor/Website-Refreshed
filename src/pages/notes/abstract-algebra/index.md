## Groups
A **group** $(G, \cdot)$ consists of a set $G$ with a binary operation such that
for all $a,b,c\in G$,
\[(ab)c = a(bc),\]
there exists an identity element $e$ with $ae=ea=a$, and every element has an
inverse.

## Rings
A **ring** $(R, +, \cdot)$ is an abelian group under addition together with a
multiplication that is associative and distributes over addition.

## Fields
A **field** is a commutative ring in which every nonzero element has a
multiplicative inverse. Classical examples are $\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{R}$ and
$\mathbb{C}$.
