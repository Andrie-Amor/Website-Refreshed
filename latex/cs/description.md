## Welcome to my CS notes page!

I'll be using this page as a personal study journal as I develop as a software engineer and researcher. I am currently interested in infrastructure engineering and systems programming. I also have experience in frontend and backend development and am always looking to improve.

I hope you'll find some value in these notes. If not, thanks for checking it out!
